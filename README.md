# Jamstroids
A 2 day MVP investigating matter.js library and musical integration to create an astroids clone. Despite tackling my first project with a physics engine, the base layer of the game is complete. I plan on continuing to work on this project in the future as a way to improve my skills with Canvas animations, SVGs, and musical integration.

My intention is to have an engaging backdrop component that can be utilized in other projects.

## Completed Steps:
* Scaffolded Astroids clone, using matter.js

## Next Goals
  Functionality
    * Create Asteriods UI overlay as react component
    * Compartmentalize into react component
    * Use Spotify API to play songs and have audio stream data inform gameplay decisions
  
* Implement Passport js and OAuth login through google API
